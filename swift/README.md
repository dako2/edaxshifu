This directory contains Swift implementations of the EdaxShifu system.

## LiveLearningCamera iOS App

The `LiveLearningCamera/` directory contains a complete iOS app built with SwiftUI and Xcode for native on-device machine learning.

### Features
- SwiftUI-based iOS application with native ML capabilities
- Xcode project with unit and UI tests
- Core ML integration for on-device inference
- Vision framework for real-time object detection
- Independent architecture - no external API dependencies

### Technical Specifications
- **Platform**: iOS 18.5+
- **Language**: Swift 5.0
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Bundle ID**: ebowwa.LiveLearningCamera

### Native iOS ML Architecture
The iOS app implements completely independent on-device machine learning:
- **Core ML**: Native iOS model inference with optimized performance
- **Vision Framework**: Real-time object detection and image analysis
- **AVFoundation**: Direct camera capture and processing
- **On-Device Training**: Local model adaptation without external dependencies

### Development Setup
1. Open `LiveLearningCamera.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Build and run on iOS Simulator or device
3. All ML processing runs natively on-device - no external dependencies required

### Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: AVFoundation camera capture and real-time preview
- **Phase 2**: Core ML model integration for object detection
- **Phase 3**: Vision framework for real-time inference and bounding boxes
- **Phase 4**: On-device learning and model adaptation
- **Phase 5**: Local annotation interface for teaching new objects
- **Phase 6**: Model export/import for sharing between devices
